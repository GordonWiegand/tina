This is a privat book project. I write some short stories for my doughters using LaTeX. 

The repository contains the up-to-date compiled pdf, binder.pdf. The file structure is simple and straightforward: binder.tex contains the LaTeX header and embeds the respective chapter files. Each .tex file contains one story. The illustrations are drawn by my doughter and are stored in ./bilder/.
